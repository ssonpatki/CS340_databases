### Citations

Source code from CS340 starter code and Flask development article was used to learn how to implement our web app with blueprints. However, other than the general structure of the files and functions, the specific code within the SQL files, the route.py files, the templates, and overall functionality of the previous files, in terms of how it's used in our web interface and for our specific database, is unique.
